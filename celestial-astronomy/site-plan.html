      <h3>Astronomic calendar</h3>
      <p>
        The second page is going to have a monthly calendar, showing all the important astronomic events that are going to happen in the currently month! Located at the top of the page, there will also be two images showing the most exciting events from the month. The purpose of these images are to help the user to be excited and start preparations to watch the most spetacular and important ones. <br> <br>The information is going to be updated from month to month, so no need rush and start making hundreds of preparations for the whole year! <br>Its always good to remember that if you want to share any information about an upcoming astronomic event that is not on the calendar, you can send an Email to me! I'll happily update it. <br> <br>And if you want to go back to the Home page you can simply click on the logo, located at the top of the page.

      <h3>Planet visibility</h3>
      <p>
        The last page is going to give you information about the most important celestial bodies you can see in the night: The solar system planets! <br> <br>Some planets like Jupiter and Venus are pretty easy to find when you look at the sky, but the others are a little bit more difficult to locate, so this page will tell you what planets are currently visible in the night sky and at what position or constelations they are! To locate them you can also use free apps that use GPS to help you find them all. <br> <br>The solar system model in the top of the page is merely illustrative, it does not represent the actual place of the planets and neither their real rotation/translation speed. <br> <br>And just like the Astronomic calendar, you can get back to the Main page by clicking the top page logo. <br> <br>(Each planet is going to have their respective symbol right above the status of visible or invisible)
