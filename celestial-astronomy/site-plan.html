      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        This website aims to help you understand a bit more about the amazing hobby of stargazing and spacial photography. You will learn the general basics here, from tips of better night view, to recommended equipment and a monthly updated calendar to help you keep track of everything!<br> <br> Thankfully, we dont actually need anything special to start stargazing! All you want to do is find a good spot to lay down and abserve the night sky. But if you want to have a really good view, you'll need to travel away from your city, and that's because cities are heavily light polluted, and that pollution conceal a huge ammount of the stars. It's a little obvious, but if you use glasses, remember to clean and bring them with you, the whole experience will be so much better if you can actually see the stars. (I forgot my glasses once...)<br> <br> There are three basic things that you should always bring even if you are going to stay at your backyard. The first one is snacks (especially if you're going to watch things that take hours like meteor showers), you dont want to miss it because you got hungry, do you? The second one is your cellphone with an app or something similar that can help you locate the constelations and planetes you want to see. And the last thing is patience! You are going to observe a natural phenomenon, you cant control the exact time it is going to happen, so bring lots of patience!<br> <br> The most basic one is a pair of binoculars. They are going to help you locate constelations more easily and also allow you to have a better view of certain "close" events, like the supermoons and meteor showers.However, if you want to look at planets then you will need to get a telescope. Telescopes are harder to use (a good one is a bit expensive) and will require you to have some practice first, but they are going to let you have a close view of our solar system planets. With them you can even see the famous saturn rings! The least popular one is a high zoom camera. These cameras are not as poweful as a telescope, but they will let you take amazing pictures of the closer celestial bodies, like the moon and jupiter. If you want, you can also use both camera and telescope together in order to take high quality photos and videos of the planets and stars!<br> <br> Always check the weather forecast before going to stargaze, you really dont want to have your night ruined because of rain or clouds. Differently from the stars, planets have a "fixed" bright, so if the "star" you are looking at is not rapidly blinking, its actually a planet! It's important to remember that your eyes need time to adapt to the dark. This process is called "dark adaptation" and it takes around 30 minutes to be done. So relax and don't use your phone in that time. If you bring a camera to your trip, try to photograph a star trail! Star trails are a kind of long exposure photos that aim to catch the movement of the stars in the sky (that "movement" happens because of the rotation of the Earth). You can take this kind of photo by leaving your camera taking pictures repeatedly at short intervals through the night and stack them on top of each other!<br> <br>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br> <br> To conclude, I'm not an expert myself, so in case you want to share information or something that is going to be helpfull to everyone, you can contact me via the Email located in the bottom of the site.

      <h3>Astronomic calendar</h3>
      <p>
        The second page is going to have a monthly calendar, showing all the important astronomic events that are going to happen in the currently month!<br> <br> December<br> <br> December 12th (New Moon)
        8:32 pm will be the best time to observe the stars, since there will be no moonlight.<br> <br> December 14th (Meteor shower)
        Under ideal conditions, it will be possible to see up to 150 meteors per hour!<br> <br> December 22 (Solstice)
        This will be the shortest day in the North Hemisphere, but the longest in the South Hemisphere.<br> <br> December 27 (Full Moon)
        Our natural satellite will be located in the Auriga constellation!<br> <br> The information in this page is going to be updated monthly. Maybe in the future I'll make it an annual calendar so you can start making preparations for the whole year!<br> <br> And its always good to remember that if you want to share any information about an upcoming astronomic event that is not on the calendar, you can send an Email to me! I'll happily update it to keep helping everyone.<br> <br> Happy stargazing and clear skyes for you to enjoy!

        The last page is going to give you information about the most important celestial bodies you can see in the night: The solar system planets! <br> <br>Some planets like Jupiter and Venus are pretty easy to find when you look at the sky, but the others are a little bit more difficult to locate, so this page will tell you what planets are currently visible in the night sky<br> <br> Mercury Curiosities: Mercury's sun-facing side is scorched by temperatures of around 430°C, hot enough to melt lead. The intense changes in temperature from day to night make it impossible for life as we know to exist in this scorching planet. It is the closest planet to the Sun, but Mercury isn't the hottest in the whole solar system. Venus's atmosphere causes a "greenhouse effect", resulting in even higher temperatures.<br> <br> Venus Curiosities: A day on Venus is almost longer than a year! And thats because Venus takes 243 Earth days to fully rotate once on its axis. The clouds of sulphuric acid located in Venus atmosphere make it very reflective and shiny, its brightness makes it visible even during the day if you know where to look. This atmosphere also conceal its surface from our view.<br> <br> Mars Curiosities: Mars is the second smallest planet in the solar system, losing just to Mercury. It can get pretty cold on Mars! And much colder than our own planet, since it's even further away from the sun, this planet can get temperatures down to -140°C! The highest mountain in our solar system (a volcano called Olympus Mons) is located in Mars, having 24 kilometres high, it's about three times the height of Mount Everest!<br> <br> Jupiter Curiosities: Jupiter is more than twice as massive as all other Solar System planets combined! And 318 times as massive as Earth. 1321 Earths could fit within a Jupiter-sized sphere! The length of the day in Jupiter is almost 9.93 hours. Jupiter has a total of 92 Moons, the four largest are known as the Galilean moons (Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto), and 12 of these 92 moons were discovered as recently as February 2023!<br> <br> Saturn Curiosities: It takes around 3 whole years to travel from Earth to Saturn. Saturn's rings look solid, but they are actually a glittering shower of ice and rocks! the rings also stretch almost as far into space as the distance between the Earth and the moon (384.400 km)<br> <br> Uranus Curiosities: Uranus was the first planet to be found with a telescope. Other planets like Venus and Jupiter can be seen in the night sky without a telescope, however Uranus cannot. Uranus is an "Ice-Gigant", and it is the coldest planet in the whole solar system. Just like Saturn, Uranus also have a set of rings! but they are lot smaller. All of the other planets in the solar system are named after Roman Gods, except Uranus. Instead, Uranus is named after a Greek God.<br> <br> Neptune Curiosities: A year on Neptune is equivalent to 164.81 Years on Earth! Thats because Neptune is so far from the Sun, that it takes a very long time to orbit around it and complete a year. Voyager 2 is the only spacecraft to have only passad close to Neptune, and no humans were on board. No spacecraft has ever orbited Neptune to study it at up close, thats because Neptune is so far away from us, that becomes very difficult to build something that can make such a journey and stay intact to do the required research.<br> <br>
