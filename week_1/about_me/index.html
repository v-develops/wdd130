    <p>Hello everyone! I am 18 years old and I'm a complete novice when it comes to programming😅, but I'm very excited to learn everything that this semester has to offer!</p>
    <p>In my free time I like to read books and pratice archery. I also like to make pixel arts and try to learn and make music composition for my projects.
    <br>I only know how to play piano, but I try my best to discover how to, and compose my own instrumental music!
    </p>
    <p>I also really like playing card games such as Magic, Yu-gi-oh!, etc.
    <br>I like card games so much that I'm even trying to make my own! </p>
    <p>Well... I'm a bit shy and not really good at writing, but I'm looking foward to work and know more about you all! :)</p>
